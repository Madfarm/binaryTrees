# Binary Trees
a collection of nodes and edges(connections between nodes)

## Unique Characteristics
- Each tree has a start node called the root node
- Each node in a tree can only have one parent node - which means there is only exactly one path from each node back to the root
- Nodes with no children are called leaves
- The length of the longest path from a leaf to the root is the tree's height

## Examples in the real world
- File structures
- Calculator's order of operations
- Top 8 bracket
